description: My stuggle with building a grpc python library with Maya 2019 on Windows

> WORKING ... VERSION... NOT COMPLETE

## Motivation

-   Internal software component (versioning service) in the studio which was written in `GO`lang had a `python` client.

```

```

## Disclaimer

Its good to take a backup of the installed `Maya 2019` directory in Program Files. This process involves tampering of the `python` package that got bundled with `Maya 2019`

## Process

```

```
