#### Problem Statement

During the upgrade process from **Ubuntu 20.10** to **Ubuntu 21.04**, while running

```
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Was hitting the error consistently about `postfix`

```
/home/naren   $ sudo apt dist-upgrade
[sudo] password for naren:

Setting up postfix (3.5.6-1) ...
setting myhostname=naren-PC.. in /etc/postfix

Postfix (main.cf) is now set up with the changes above.  If you need to make
changes, edit /etc/postfix/main.cf (and others) as needed.  To view Postfix
configuration values, see postconf(1).

After modifying main.cf, be sure to run 'systemctl reload postfix'.

Running newaliases
newaliases: warning: valid_hostname: misplaced delimiter: naren-PC..
newaliases: fatal: file /etc/postfix/main.cf: parameter myhostname: bad parameter value: my-PC..
dpkg: error processing package postfix (--configure):

Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.33-0ubuntu5) ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
 postfix
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

```

#### Solution

-   Observe the `value: my-PC..` in the error
-   Open up the `/etc/postfix/main.cf` in an editor with `sudo` mode

```
sudo vim /etc/postfix/main.cf
```

-   Find the line that has the following

```
myhostname = my-PC..
```

-   Replace with the following

```
myhostname = my-PC.name
```

-   Reload the `postfix` service

```
etc/init.d/postfix reload
```

Should show the following

```
$ /etc/init.d/postfix reload
Reloading postfix configuration (via systemctl): postfix.service.
```

Now when you run `sudo apt upgrade -y`, we should have no errors !

#### Fixed Run

```
$ sudo apt upgrade
